Life is what you make it, and people in the Singularity define their own schedule. There is a cafe is an open 
social place where people can work, and eat, and chat with each other with music going on.

We have a large coworking space where people can work on their digital projects. This includes 'The Library' 
where silence is enforced and people can work / study without interuption.

The culture of The Singularity is really defined by the people and camps who stay there. Camps especially are
encouraged to host activities for the uplift of the general community. Everyone in The Singularity is encouraged 
to participate and share being especially generous helping younger people pick up technical, professional and life 

The theme camps host most of the day to day activities in The Singularity. Each camp has its own routine with some
private meetings, and some public gatherings.
