        The Singularity is happening on an open piece of land near the Bangalore airport just north of the city. 
        It is a festival of learning, and enacting the future. It is a place where we live in the future and see what is missing.

        <p>
        We cos-play a rural cyber scenario with
        electric unicycles, high speed internet, cheap smart phones, solar power, lithium batteries,
        powerful personal speakers, autonomous drones, chatbots, and the gig economy.
        </p>

        Here androids are common place, everything is electric, we are built it yourself confident.
        </p>
        <p>
        Come. Camp with us. Take an online class. Work on your startup idea. Work on an open source project. Make Art. Do Yoga. Meditate. 
        Have Fun. Celebrate.

        This is a camping festival. We create the structures we want to live in and work in. People learn online, work online, play online, 
        and also work in the physical world
        </p>
        <p>
        A festival pass costs 10,000 Inr. which entitles access to the space for a 3 month season. 
        They can pitch a tent or build a temporary structure. 
        Tentâ€™s need to be taken down if not occupied for awhile. Structures are generally taken down and rebuilt each quarter.
