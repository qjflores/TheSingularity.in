The Singularity is happening on an open piece of land near the Bangalore airport just north of the city. 
It is a festival of learning, and enacting the future. It is a place where we live in the future and see what is missing. 
<p>
We cos-play a rural cyber scenario with
electric unicycles, high speed internet, cheap smart phones, solar power, lithium batteries,
powerful personal speakers, autonomous drones, chatbots, and the gig economy.
<p>
Here androids are common place, everything is electric, we are built it yourself confident.
<p>
Come. Camp with us. Take an online class. Work on your startup idea. Work on an open source project. Make Art. Do Yoga. Meditate. 
Have Fun. Celebrate.
<p>
This is a camping festival. We create the structures we want to live in and work in. People learn online, work online, play online, 
and also work in the physical world
<p>
A festival pass costs 10,000 Inr. which entitles access to the space for a 3 month season. 
They can pitch a tent or build a temporary structure. 
Tent’s need to be taken down if not occupied for awhile. Structures are generally taken down and rebuilt each quarter.

Different communities set up camps. Jaaga sets up camps for coworking and colearning. 
Startups, Special Interest Groups, and just groups of friends set up camps together.
